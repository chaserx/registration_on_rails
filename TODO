== Testing

unit, functional, and integration tests


== DB / ActiveRecord optimization

Reduce the number of hits to the DB through Caches, etc. 


== Authorization

Limit the index, destroy, update, and edit actions of the registration controller to an administrator
If and only if user table is empty, then show create new admin user. Allow create new user only after login by admin. 
Could set the initial admin information in the config.yml file using a rake task.

Mail a confirmation to registrant, billing officer, and admin
Mail a reminder to registrant X days before event. 


== App availability

Control registration availability by comparing Time.now to datetime in config.yml


== Abstracts

Done. 11.17.08 - Download all abstracts into a single zip file


== Registration Fees

Done. 11.23.08
Added a case statement to set fees based on status and going to the evening session.
The fees/prices could be pulled out to the config.yml file.
Although, there are no plans to include a payment gateway. Instructions for paying by check or purchase order will be implemented. 
Specifically, if registrants signup for dinner they will be charged a fee.

A receipt.
Give the user a pretty and printer friendly page that confirms their confirmation.
Now Recording fees. 11.23.08 - Show fees if any.
