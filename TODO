Items left undone:

== DB / ActiveRecord optimization

Reduce the number of hits to the DB. Caches, etc. 

== Authorization

Limit the index, destroy, update, and edit actions of the registration controller to an administrator

== Mailer

Mail a confirmation to registrant, billing officer, and admin

== App availability

Control registration availability by comparing Time.now to datetime in config.yml

== Abstracts

Done. 11.17.08 - Download all abstracts into a single zip file

== Style

Really could use a lot of work making this pretty.

== Welcome
Change route to welcome controller 
index action
Static page with info and link to register
