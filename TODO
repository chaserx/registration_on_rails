Items left undone:

== DB / ActiveRecord optimization

Reduce the number of hits to the DB through Caches, etc. 


== Authorization

Limit the index, destroy, update, and edit actions of the registration controller to an administrator
If and only if user table is empty, then show create new admin user. Allow create new user only after login by admin. 


== Mailer

Mail a confirmation to registrant, billing officer, and admin
Mail a reminder to registrant X days before event. 


== App availability

Control registration availability by comparing Time.now to datetime in config.yml


== Abstracts

Done. 11.17.08 - Download all abstracts into a single zip file


== Style

Need help. This really will require a lot of work making this pretty.


== Welcome

Change map.root route to a welcome controller where to post a (semi-)static event page.
